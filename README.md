# Deeplearn.js meets p5

Interactive experiments using [deeplearn.js](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs) and [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js).

Most of the examples are ports of Daniel Shiffman [Nature of Code Intelligence and Learning examples](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning).

The `/examples` folder contains ES6 and plain js files.
